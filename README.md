## octahedral-encoding

Octahedral encoding of direction vectors that reduces memory requirement and provides faster conversion
compared to spherical encoding via angles. Additionally, it provides better encoded vectors distribution
than spherical encoding. Optional mapping of encoded vectors to UV space is provided. Program also contains
reasoning and derivation for every step of octahedral encoding.

### Result of octahedraly encoding direction vectors and mapping them to UV space.
